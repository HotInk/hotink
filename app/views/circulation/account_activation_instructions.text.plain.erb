Hey, you!

Congratulations, you're the first Manager of a brand-new Hot Ink 
publishing account.

Once you activate your account, you can add other users by pressing 
"Manage account" and clicking "Users". After new users have activated
their accounts, you can promote whoever is appropriate to share your
management responsibilities. It's recommended that each account have
more than one manager.

If you need help at any point, email your Hot Ink administrator 
Chris Dinn at chris@hotink.net.

To get started, follow the link below (or paste it into your browser 
address bar.) For security reasons, this invitation will only be valid 
for ONE WEEK.

<%= @edit_account_activation_url %>

Once you've activated your account, you can log into your site admin area
by visiting <%= root_url %>.

Hot Ink is still in its infancy, so you may find some small bugs or a 
few broken features. We're constantly working to make things perfect, 
so please take the timeto file a report on any bugs you encounter. You 
can find a link to our bug reporting system at the bottom of every page.

Thanks for your interest in Hot Ink.

Rob, Chris, Andrew and Mark
The Hot Ink Team
